*** lesson ***
1. if you want to compare two whether elements of one set is available in another set, and all the elements of both sets are known. It is better to test if element of larger set is there in smaller set rather than testing if element of smaller set is there in larger set (refer suggested.py one element of random string set is checked with alphabet set rather than other way around)
2. python has some predefined sets (string.ascii_lowercase)
3. why is it better to run .lower() once rather than multiple times, doesn't .lower() have to iterate the whole string increasing time
4. analyse down time complexity
